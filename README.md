# Spotify_Youtube

With Python 3.x, make a GET request using Spotify's API and recieve the top "n" albums from a certain country from the current date. With the albums name, the script will write a query search in Youtube and select the first video result (from each album), opening it in a new tab when the previous video is over.

The first tab will open a certain Youtube video and once is it over, the next one will be launched in a new tab. This process will continue until there are no more files to be queried.

Pre-requisites:
 - An OAuth token (generated by Spotify) is needed in order to grant access to Spotify's API.
 - To gererate an OAuth token, one must have a Spotify account.
 - The following python libraries will be used: requests, webbrowser, json, urllib.request, urllib.parse, re and time.
 
Here, https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-new-releases/, click on "GET OAUTH TOKEN", then, the login screen will 
and appear after filling the necessary account information, the token will be avaliable.

If the following error message appears: "KeyError: 'albums'", then, the OAuth token has expired and, therefore, a new has to be generated.
